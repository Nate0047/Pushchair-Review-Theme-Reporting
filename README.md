# Pushchair-Review-Theme-Reporting
A prototype flexdahsboard to report thematic analysis (from Nvivo) of popular pushchair on Amazon

Aim of the project is to analyse the qual data thematically in Nvivo, and then export the results into a Flexdashboard in built in R.

Data was downloaded from Amazon (https://www.amazon.co.uk/Hauck-Pushchair-Foldable-Position-Adjustable/product-reviews/B01LRUWAKY/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews) to a .xlsx file. It gives us the first 100 reviews of the pushchair whihc can be viewed in Excel. 

This data can be read directly into NVivo for thematic analysis. Once thematic analysis is complete, user can create a 'Framework Matrix' with participants on rows and themes in columns. After using the 'auto summarise' function in the matrix you can right-click on the top left of the matrix and export this to .xlsx. This exported matrix can be used to join back to the main data, get an overview of theme counts and provide visuals on thematic analysis.
