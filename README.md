# Pushchair-Review-Theme-Reporting
A prototype flexdahsboard to report thematic analysis (from Nvivo) of popular pushchair on Amazon

Data was downloaded from Amazon (https://www.amazon.co.uk/Hauck-Pushchair-Foldable-Position-Adjustable/product-reviews/B01LRUWAKY/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews) to a CSV file. It gives us the first 100 reviews of the pushchair. 

Aim of the project is to analyse the qual data thematically in Nvivo, and then export the results into a Flexdashboard in built in R.
